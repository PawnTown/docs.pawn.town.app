This guide will take you through how to embed the move history and tailor its appearance to complement your platform's design ðŸŽ¨. Letâ€™s begin!

## HTML

To showcase the move history on your platform, use the following embed link. Remember to replace `[streamId]` with your specific live stream ID:

  width="100%"
  height="400"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no"
></iframe>
```

# Integrating Move History from PawnTown

Integrate the move history from PawnTown's chess streams to provide your viewers with a clear and concise record of each game. This guide covers the process for embedding move history and customizing its appearance to suit your platform's design.

## Embed HTML

To showcase the move history on your platform, use the following embed link. Remember to replace `[streamId]` with your specific live stream ID:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://pawn.town/s/[streamId]/embed/moves"
  width="100%"
  height="400"
  frameborder="0"
  scrolling="no"
></iframe>
```

# Integrating the Full Player from PawnTown

Embedding PawnTown's full player into your platform allows you to showcase a live chess game, directly enhancing the user's experience. This guide will walk you through the embedding process, and also discuss customization options to match your desired appearance.

## Embed Link

To integrate the full player, utilize the following embed link, where `[streamId]` should be replaced with the unique ID of your live stream:

```html
<iframe src="https://pawn.town/s/[streamId]/embed" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

## Customizing Appearance via Query Parameters

PawnTown provides a query API, allowing you to customize the appearance of the embedded chess board and its associated features. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. Board Colors:

- **Light Square Color (`l`)**: Define the color of the light squares.
- **Dark Square Color (`d`)**: Define the color of the dark squares.

You can choose a color value like `green` or hex `%23000000` (=`#000000`).

Example: `https://pawn.town/s/[streamId]/embed?l=%23e0e0e0&d=%23202020`

### 2. Show Evaluation (`e`):

Toggle the display of the board's evaluation. Use `true` to show, and `false` to hide.

Example: `https://pawn.town/s/[streamId]/embed?e=true`

### 3. Control Bar (`c`):

Toggle the visibility of the control bar. Use `true` to show, and `false` to hide.

Example: `https://pawn.town/s/[streamId]/embed?c=false`
